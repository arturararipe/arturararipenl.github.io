The flagship of console exclusivity is soon to be available for everyone, and it's a huge deal. Sony had already mentioned their intention to bring some of their titles to PC, but people didn't expect a GoW port. It has been, consistently, since the PlayStation 2 days, one of the main reasons why a PC gamer would also own a console. Certainly not the sole reason, but definitely a solid argument, along with The Last of Us (not on PC yet, but who knows what the future will bring?). 

I'm no specialist, but if Sony brought their major player over, it might also mean that titles such as Gran Turismo might eventually make their way into the platform as well (fingers crossed). At the end of the day, everyone wins. More money, potentially better releases over time and even the environment ends up benefitting greatly, given pc gamers wouldn't need to buy a PS4 or PS5 as their secondary gaming device just for exclusives. Console people would continue buying consoles and computer people would stick to their computers, a clear win-win situation.

Microsoft did the same with their exclusives, such as Forza Horizon, Forza Motorsport and Gears of War, and the results were absurdly positive, yielding insane profits and they even went as far as swallowing their pride and offering their titles on Steam, which Sony also chose as their place to be on PC. A single platform bringing the best of both worlds with fair prices and trading cards. What else could one ask for?

With hardware prices going up like there's no tomorrow and overall console availability being rather low, and with the rather convenient advent of cloud gaming services, the end of "only on PlayStation" is a godsent. Gaming should be for everyone, independently of platform. 

In the near future, one should be able to play The Last of Us on Xbox via browser which is in fact running cloud gaming service like GeForce Now, for example. Or even the other way around, like speeding through the vast mexican landscape of Forza Horizon 5 in your PlayStation 5, which is actually running xCloud via browser. How exciting is that?
